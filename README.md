## New Feature

This repository now includes a simple web-based tool for transcribing audio files using OpenAI models. After starting the FastAPI app, open `/static/transcribe.html` to upload an audio file and receive a transcript.

### Running the server

1. Install the Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install `ffmpeg` if you want to transcribe files that are not in one of OpenAI's supported formats (`mp3`, `mp4`, `mpeg`, `mpga`, `m4a`, `wav`, or `webm`). The application uses `pydub` to convert unsupported files, which requires `ffmpeg` to be available on your system.

3. Export your OpenAI API key:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

4. Launch the server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn src.app:app --reload
   ```
