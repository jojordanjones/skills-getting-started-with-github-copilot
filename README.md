## New Feature

This repository now includes a simple web-based tool for transcribing audio files using OpenAI models. After starting the FastAPI app, open `/static/transcribe.html` to upload an audio file and receive a transcript.

## Running the App Locally

1. Install the Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set your OpenAI API key (required for the transcription tool):

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
   ```

3. Launch the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

   ```bash
   uvicorn src.app:app --reload
   ```

4. Visit `http://localhost:8000/static/index.html` in your browser. From there you can navigate to the transcription page.
