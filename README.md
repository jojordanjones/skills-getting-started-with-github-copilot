## New Feature

This repository now includes **Tech Joint**, a simple site for hosting tools. The first tool lets you transcribe audio using OpenAI's Whisper model.

### Running Tech Joint

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set your OpenAI API key in the environment:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```
3. Start the server with Uvicorn:
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.app:app --reload
   ```
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000/static/index.html` to see the tools.

The transcription page will prompt you to upload an audio file and returns the text. The API key is required for this feature to function.
